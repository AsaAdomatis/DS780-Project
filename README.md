## 1. Motivation

*The purpose* of the repository is twofold: 1) collect and pre-process glucose data sets 2) establish baseline performance. *The goal* is to create a unified self-contained repository which would be a starting place for researchers and practioners to compare and develop old and new methods. *An example* of successful implemntation of a similar repository for tabular data sets can be found [here](https://github.com/Yura52/tabular-dl-revisiting-models).

## 2. Overview

Currently, the main tasks are the following:

1. Familiarize yourself with the problem and the setup. For this you can use the papers included in [here](./papers).

2. Get to know how we want to structure the data. Each data set is going to come in a different format. We want to unify their format and prepare them for easy use with the major ML libraries such as PyTorch. For an example of how ready-to-use PyTorch datasets look like, see [here](./example_dataset/).
