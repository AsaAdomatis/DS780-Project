## 1. Motivation

*The purpose* of the repository is twofold: 1) collect and pre-process glucose data sets 2) establish baseline performance. *The goal* is to create a unified self-contained repository which would be a starting place for researchers and practioners to compare and develop old and new methods. *An example* of successful implementation of a similar repository for tabular data sets can be found [here](https://github.com/Yura52/tabular-dl-revisiting-models).

## 2. Overview

The main goal of the project is to create a unified library of glucose data sets and establish simple benchmarks for prediction. The timeline for the project split into weeks tentatively looks as:

- [x] (January 25) Familiarize with the existing code base / DARTS library
- [ ] ~~(February 1) Hyper-parameter (Optuna) optimization for ARIMA~~
- [ ] ~~(February 1) Results (with statistics) and timing for ARIMA~~
- [ ] (February 1) Add all covariates to all data sets
- [ ] (February 8) Add LinearRegression, RandomForest, and XGBModel
- [ ] (February 15) Get cluster access for GPU
- [ ] (Feburary 15) Add RNNModel, NBEATS, and TFT
- [ ] (February 22) Switch to new data sets, perform pre-processing
- [ ] (February 22) Add ARIMA, LinearRegression, RandomForest, and XGBModel
- [ ] (March 1) Add RNNModel, NBEATS, and TFT
- [ ] (March 8) Switch to new data sets, perform pre-processing
- [ ] (March 15) Add ARIMA, LinearRegression, RandomForest, and XGBModel
- [ ] (March 22) Add RNNModel, NBEATS, and TFT
- [ ] (...) Analysis / paper writing
- [ ] (May 11) **Hard deadline for submission to NeurIPS**  -->
