For an overview of the general state of the art in the glucose trajectory prediction, the reader is referred to the paper by Oviedo et al. Oviedo et al outlines what general directions for modeling blood glucose exist: traditional ML, deep learning etc. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the common advantages and disadvantages of each family opt the methods.

For an introduction to the deep learning (DL) based approaches to glucose modeling, the reader is referred to the paper by Fox et al. The paper offers a gentle introduction to the main concepts of DL and problem definition. Many of the methods and dat sets that we will be using rely on the code written (or having similar style) by the authors. Therefore, understanding how the authors formulate the problem is crucial for working with the code later on.
